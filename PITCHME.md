- Help learners focus their attention on a single page, where implementation meets information. 
- Make all the computational material readily available for executing code online, with one click.  
- Use interactive widgets to create a seamless learning experience. Few gestures can surrogate multiple lines of code.

- Make the most out of the interactive medium to get your points across clearly.  
- Organize text and one or more computational environment in one place.  
- Feed your data into the publication from your favorite data repository.

--> Can I start writing my paper in Jupyter Book? 

In theory, you can. But in practice, Jupyter Book's ecosystem does not provide you with a word processor for collaborative text editing. So, it may not be the most convenient way to start writing a paper from scratch. It is a medium where you bring different pieces together to create an open, interactive and reproducible publication. 

--> My work does not include any code. What value can Jupyter Books add to my workflow? 

--> License? 

--> Citing?
