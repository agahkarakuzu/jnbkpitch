##### @color[white](Imagine people who'd like to learn how to use a programming tool or a computation-linked subject. Bouncing between documents and a software won't make it any easier for them, let alone getting all the neccesary tools working properly. Creating interactive tutorials with Jupyter Books, you can take this burden away: )

@title[FAQ]

--> Can I start writing my paper in Jupyter Book? 

In theory, you can. But in practice, Jupyter Book's ecosystem does not provide you with tools for collaborative text editing. So, it may not be the most convenient way to start writing a paper from scratch. It is a medium where you bring different pieces together to create an open, interactive and reproducible publication. 

--> My work does not include any code. What value can Jupyter Books bring to my workflow? 

--> License? 

--> Citing?
